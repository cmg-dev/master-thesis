	abstract = "In this paper, we present an UHF RFID location tracking system, which is based on measuring the phases of back- scattered signals from RFID tag using multiple spatially distributed antennas ata singlecarrier frequency. Thewavelengthambiguityof the phase measurements is resolved by using the extended Kalman Ô¨Ålter (EKF) and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, where the state includes the position, velocity and the phase offsets of antennas. The performance of themethodis experimentally",
