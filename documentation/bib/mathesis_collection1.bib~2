	tracking system, which is based on measuring the phases of back-
	scattered signals from RFID tag using multiple spatially distributed
	antennas ata singlecarrier frequency. Thewavelengthambiguityof
	the phase measurements is resolved by using the extended Kalman
	ﬁlter (EKF) and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, where
	the state includes the position, velocity and the phase offsets of
	antennas. The performance of themethodis experimentally"
