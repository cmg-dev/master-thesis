	abstract = "Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used for
inventory and asset tracking because of its accuracy and speed.  Currently, RFID
tracking systems are being used to identify and locate tagged objects in indoor
environments.  In this research, received signal strength indication (RSSI)
values are collected from off-the-shelf passive
RFID readers and antennas to be used in conjunction with an artificial neural
network (ANN) to create a localization algorithm for two-dimensional location
estimation with a single tag.  The aim of this research is to create a highly
accurate real-time location tracking system to be used in a room with objects
that create RF interference.  Multiple
linear regression is used as a benchmark method for comparison with artificial neural networks. ",
