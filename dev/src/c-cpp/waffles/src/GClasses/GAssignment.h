///\brief An abstract base class defining an assignment between two sets
///
/// An assignment is a mapping M between two sets A and B.  If a and b
/// are elements of A and B respectively, then the following
/// properties hold:
///
/// - M(a) is a single element of B or is undefined
/// - M(b) is a single element of A or is undefined
/// - M(a) == b if and only if M(b) == a
/// 
/// More specifically, an assignment is a graph-theoretic matching on
/// a bipartite graph.
///
/// Practically, this is implemented by denoting the members of the
/// two sets with non-negative integers.  Undefined mappings are just
/// given as mapping to -1.  sizeA() and sizeB() give the number of
/// elements in each set.  The members of A are then denoted as
/// 0..sizeA()-1 and the members of B as the integers 0..sizeB()-1
///
/// operator()(int) gives the mapping from A->B (as in 
/// \code if(assignment(1)==-1){do_something();} \endcode )
///
/// inverse(int) gives the mapping from B->A (as in 
/// \code if(assignment.inverse(1)==-1){do_something();} \endcode )
