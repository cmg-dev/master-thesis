	/// The token may include delimiters if it is enclosed in quotes or
	/// the delimiters are escaped.
	///
	/// If the next token begins with single or double quotes, then the
	/// token will be delimited by the quotes. If a newline character or
	/// the end-of-file is encountered before the matching quote, then
	/// an exception is thrown.  The quotation marks are not included in
	/// the token, but they are consumed by the operation.  The escape
	/// character is ignored inside quotes - unlike what would happen in
