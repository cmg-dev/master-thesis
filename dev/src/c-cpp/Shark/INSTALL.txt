Some notes on the compilation and installation of the Shark
libraries, served chilled. If something goes wrong remember:
It's not the bite, it's the fight!

For an overview about all references and manuals attached to this Shark 
distribution please refer to the file "doc/index.html".

If you have no idea how to install a library from sources you will
probabily find the Shark installation tutorials at

doc/tutorials/Install/index.html (Unix/Linux/Mac OS)
doc/tutorials/InstallWin/index.html (Windows) 

helpful. They give step-by-step explanations of the commands involved
with additional helpful comments. Additionally, pre-compiled versions
for Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows (Visual Studio 2008 Express) are available from our homepage:

Unix/Linux/Mac/compatible:
--------------------------

####### Compilation #######

The Shark library uses the cmake tool (http://www.cmake.org) to create
a top-level Makefile. Run "cmake ." in the toplevel directory;

Run "make" to compile the library and "make test" to run the
accompanying unit tests of the library. If you would like to generate 
the documentation, simply run "make doc".

To sum up, the whole procedure should be as easy as:

> cmake .
> make

Make sure to include Shark in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable or run

> make install

as a root user to install Shark to a central path (/usr/local by default).

Windows:
--------

On the Microsoft Windows platform, you need to run the cmake (either
the command-line program or the GUI program) on the top-level
directory of the shark library. This procedure generates project files suitable for the
compiler/IDE that is installed on your system. Thereafter, open the
project files in your IDE or invoke your build system.
