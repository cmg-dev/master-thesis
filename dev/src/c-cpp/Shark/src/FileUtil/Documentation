<h2>Reference for the FileUtil package</h2>

<p>
FileUtil provides basic functions for file input/output,
extending the standard C++ libraries.
The package provides special support for reading tagged
values from configuration files.
</p>

<p>
The usage of configuration files can significantly improve
the flexibility of Shark based software. There are two
different levels of configuration file support, which are
illustrated by the <a href="examples.html">examples</a>
provided with the library.
</p>

<p>
A very simple and easy to use functionality is provided by
the methods scanFrom and scanFrom_strict, which search a
text based configuration file for a tagged value. The
template based implementation ensures type safety. This
set of functions is completely sufficient for simple
configuration settings.
</p>

<p>
For more complicated configuration files with lots of
parameters FileUtil provides the Params class. It serves
as a base class of an application specific configuration
class holding all parameters in a single central object.
