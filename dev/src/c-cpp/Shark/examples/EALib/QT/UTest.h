//! \brief perform a Mann-Whitney U-Test
//!
//! \par
//! This function performs a Mann-Whitney U-Test.
//! There are one-sided and two-sided tests
//! available. In all cases the null-hypothesis is
//! equality of the distributions of both samples.
//!
//! \par
//! The alternatives are as follows:
//! <table>
//!   <tr>
//!     <td><b>test type</b></th><td><b>alternative</b></td>
//!   </tr>
//!   <tr>
//!     <td>A left of B</th><td>distribution of sample-A produces smaller values than distribution of sample-B</td>
//!     <td>B left of A</th><td>distribution of sample-A produces larger values than distribution of sample-B</td>
//!     <td>two-sided</th><td>distribution of sample-A produces smaller or larger values than distribution of sample-B</td>
//!   </tr>
//! </table>
//!
//! \par
//! As usual, a normal approximation is used for
//! large sample sizes.
//!
//! \param  sampleA       values in the first sample
//! \param  sampleB       values in the second sample
//! \param  alternative   type of alternative (UTEST_LEFTSIDED, UTEST_RIGHTSIDED, UTEST_TWOSIDED)
//! \param  p_twosided    p-value: largest type 1 error for which the two-sided test discards the null-hypothesis
//! \param  p_A_leftOf_B  p-value: largest type 1 error for which the one-sided test discards the null-hypothesis
//! \param  p_B_leftOf_A  p-value: largest type 1 error for which the one-sided test discards the null-hypothesis
//!
void UTest(const std::vector<double>& sampleA, const std::vector<double>& sampleB, double& p_twosided, double& p_A_leftOf_B, double& p_B_leftOf_A);
